                                This is initially a military surveillance and combat drone when I realized that this is too impossible to accomplish during my bachelor years. So it turned out to be a drone that will assess the effects of the disaster. This device is useful in assessing the damages done by the disaster. It can evaluate the amount of the damaged infrastructure, crops, and land in urban and rural areas. It also can sense missing bodies through its built in thermal camera that can sense heat with the depth of 5 meters. This is helpful especially in search and rescue operations.

                                The cool thing about this is it is AI aided. The UI is a standalone one that does not need to connect to the internet to access the data it needs. It has a 360Â° camera that will serve as its eye and its propellers as to roam around. It uses AI to tell where it will move over an obstacle or to whatever it wants to go.

                                One of my dreams is to be a Senior Programmer/Analyst. I honestly have little to no idea about that but I find it interesting especially its name. It is a person who is in charge of the development of the software and of the analytics at the same time. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Also, what I know about being a senior programmer/analyst is that he/she is in charge of the development, construction, and maintain the software they are developing. They need to research on the ways on how to improve the system and incorporate it in their software. This is the job that the software can be left after it was developed. He/She needs to be wary of the feedback of the clients the software serves. He/She also needs to think of strategies on how to solve issues like bugs and errors, to change the UI of the software as it is needed, and to add essential features to the software itself.

                                This is my passion company that I imagined ever since I was in grade 7. Companion is inspired by Umbrella Corporation from Resident Evil and Stark Industries from Ironman and Avengers which showcases high-tech weapons and vehicles. This is initially only built for high-technology military vehicles such as tanks, warships, and aircraft carriers. I am planning to build spacecrafts for planetary defense in case of alien invasion. These are all when I was a young teenager.

                                This time, I am planning to continue to aim its establishment out of my inspiration to Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, Tesla, and Starlink. The company's goal is to provide high technology equipment such as multimedia productions and to provide high-tech military warfare vehicles and defense systems such as tanks, warships, guns, jet fighters, choppers, stealth bombers, submarines, and more. It also provides intelligence equipment such as AI Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and combat drones.

                                Aside from military equipment, it also aims to partner with SpaceX to build space rockets that can explore space and helps in construction of the new International Space Station in the future. This is to raise the Philippine technology and explorations to the highest level that can even surpass USA, Russia, China, and
